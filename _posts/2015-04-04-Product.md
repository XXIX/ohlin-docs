### Featured image

The first image for the Product will be used as the Featured image on all listings pages such as [Shop](https://ohlin.myshopify.com/collections/all).

### Tags
Be sure to tag the image with the proper collection and year, this helps out with the ease of sorting images in the Shopify Admin. Ex. a product from the Fall-Winter 2015 collection should be tagged with "FW15"

### Hiding an image

To hide an image from the shop and product page, but still show it as the
featured image on a collection page, add the `alt` tag `product-hide`.

### Alternate featured image

You can set an alternate featured image which will be flipped at random when a user is on a listing page.

The alternate image can be set by setting the `alt` as `featured-alt`.
