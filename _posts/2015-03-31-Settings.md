### Notification Bar

To edit the Notifcation Bar, go to `Online Store > Themes > Customize Theme > Notification Bar`.

From there, the notification bar can be configured as one of two ways:

#### Session

The notification bar can be dismissed by the user, but will reappear when they come back to the store.

#### Campaign

The notification bar is setup with a specific `campaign ID` and when the user closes the bar they will never see the notification bar for this given `campaign ID` again. When the `campaign ID` is updated, the user will then see the notification bar again.

You can set the following:
+ Show or hide the notification bar
+ Type: session or cookie (campaign)
+ Campaign ID: only used for Cookie type
+ Text: Copy shown in the notification bar
+ Link: Destination for user after clicking the bar
